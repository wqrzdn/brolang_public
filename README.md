## 🌟 What is BroLang?

BroLang is a revolutionary educational programming language that breaks down barriers in tech by using familiar slang and cultural expressions. Born from internet memes and Gen Z culture, it transforms intimidating programming syntax into language that feels natural and fun.

**Inspired by memes, powered by education** - BroLang takes viral expressions like "no cap" (no lie), "lock" (secure/set), and "say" (speak) and turns them into actual programming keywords. Some references might be classics, but the vibe is timeless!

**Traditional Code:**
```javascript
if (score >= 90) {
    console.log("Grade: A");
} else {
    console.log("Keep trying!");
}
```

**BroLang (Meme-Powered):**
```brolang
no cap (score >= 90) {
    say "Grade: A - You're a top G!"
} nah {
    say "Keep grinding, you got this!"
}
```

*From "no cap" memes to actual conditionals - now that's what we call cultural programming!* 🔥

## 📖 Documentation

### 🎭 **Meme Origins**
BroLang keywords come straight from internet culture:

- **`no cap`** - Popular slang meaning "no lie" or "for real" → Perfect for truth conditions
- **`lock`** - Secure/set something in place → Natural for variable declarations  
- **`say`** - Straightforward communication → Ideal for output statements
- **`wloop`** - "We looping!" energy → While loops with personality
- **`yappin`** - Continuous talking/iterating → For loops that make sense
- **`nah`** - Classic dismissal → The perfect "else" statement

*Some might be older memes, but good culture is timeless!* 💯

### Basic Syntax

#### Variables
```brolang
// Variable declaration
lock name = "Student"
lock age = 16
lock gpa = 3.8

// Variable updates
age = age + 1
```

#### Output
```brolang
say "What's good!"
say "Name: " + name
say "Age: " + age
```

#### Conditionals
```brolang
// If-else statements
no cap (gpa >= 3.5) {
    say "Dean's List - you're killing it!"
} nah {
    say "Keep pushing, success is coming!"
}

// Nested conditions
no cap (age >= 18) {
    no cap (gpa >= 3.0) {
        say "College ready!"
    } nah {
        say "Focus on those grades"
    }
} nah {
    say "Finish high school strong"
}
```

#### Loops
```brolang
// While loops
lock countdown = 5
say "Launch countdown:"
wloop (countdown > 0) {
    say countdown
    countdown = countdown - 1
}
say "Blast off! 🚀"

// For loops
say "Grinding through the levels:"
yappin (1 to 10) {
    say "Level " + i + " complete!"
}
```

#### Math Operations
```brolang
lock x = 10
lock y = 5

say "Addition: " + (x + y)      // 15
say "Subtraction: " + (x - y)   // 5  
say "Multiplication: " + (x * y) // 50
say "Division: " + (x / y)      // 2
```

## 🎯 Examples

### 🏫 **Grade Calculator**
```brolang
lock student = "Alex"
lock math_score = 95
lock english_score = 87
lock science_score = 92

lock average = (math_score + english_score + science_score) / 3
say student + "'s average: " + average

no cap (average >= 90) {
    say "A student - you're absolutely crushing it!"
} nah {
    no cap (average >= 80) {
        say "B student - solid work, keep it up!"
    } nah {
        say "Room for improvement - let's level up!"
    }
}
```

### 💰 **Savings Goal Tracker**
```brolang
lock goal = 1000
lock saved = 0
lock weekly_amount = 50
lock weeks = 0

say "Saving for that new setup 💻"
say "Goal: $" + goal

wloop (saved < goal) {
    saved = saved + weekly_amount
    weeks = weeks + 1
    say "Week " + weeks + ": Saved $" + saved
}

say "Goal reached in " + weeks + " weeks! 🎉"
say "Time to cop that gear!"
```

### 🎮 **Gaming Level System**
```brolang
lock player = "TopG_Coder"
lock xp = 0
lock level = 1

say "Welcome " + player + "!"

yappin (1 to 5) {
    say "\n--- Battle " + i + " ---"
    lock battle_xp = i * 100
    xp = xp + battle_xp
    say "Earned " + battle_xp + " XP"
    
    no cap (xp >= level * 500) {
        level = level + 1
        say "🎉 LEVEL UP! Now level " + level
    }
    
    say "Total XP: " + xp
}

say "\nFinal Stats:"
say "Level: " + level
say "XP: " + xp
say "You're ready for the next challenge! 💯"
```

## 🎭 About BroLang & The Creator

### 📖 **The Origin Story**
BroLang was born in **December 2023** from a simple idea: what if programming felt like texting your friends instead of talking to a robot? Also implement your brain rot 🧠💀

**Lonely me** created this whole language, got hyped about it, then... completely forgot to host it. Was too busy scrolling memes. Spent months doom scrolling instead of deploying. But hey, better late than never! 

*Sometimes the best projects marinate in your localhost for a while (forever)* 😅

### 🧠 **The Philosophy**
**"Why should programming feel like reading ancient scrolls?"**

Traditional code:
```javascript
if (userIsAwesome) {
    console.log("You rock!");
}
```

BroLang:
```brolang
no cap (userIsAwesome) {
    say "You rock!";
}
```

*Same logic, way more fun!* 🔥

### 🛠️ **Technical BS:**
Built this bad boy from scratch with:
- **Custom Tokenizer**: Regex wizardry that understands slang
- **Recursive Descent Parser**: Proper CS fundamentals but make it fun
- **Tree-Walking Interpreter**: Direct execution, no compilation needed
- **Meme-Driven Design**: Every keyword has cultural significance

### 🎯 **For Recruiters & Tech Folks (my crush)**
BroLang showcases:
- **Language Design**: Built a complete programming language from zero
- **Parser Theory**: Tokenization, AST generation, operator precedence
- **JavaScript Mastery**: Complex interpreter patterns and DOM manipulation
- **UI/UX Innovation**: Educational tools that actually engage users
- **Cultural Awareness**: Understanding what makes tech accessible
- **Project Management**: ...okay maybe not this one (forgot to deploy) 😂

### 👨‍💻 **About Creator**
**Current Status:** Finally hosting projects instead of just doom scrolling 📱➡️💻

**Background:**
- Created BroLang in Dec 2023 during a "what if" moment
- Passionate about making programming accessible to everyone
- Believes the best code is code that makes people smile and fall in love with me
- Expert at building cool stuff and forgetting to share it (trying to work on this!)
